To support mentorship in a Web3 community, an AI bot will be created to help members find curated Web3 content and policies. It will act as a step-by-step mentor, offering personalized recommendations based on user interests and knowledge.

##Key features of the bot include:
Personalized Content Recommendations: The bot will recommend curated articles, videos, tutorials, and resources tailored to the member's interests and expertise level in web3.
Step-by-Step Guidance: The bot will provide a structured learning path with sequential steps to help members navigate through the complex world of web3 technologies.
Policy Education: The bot will share information and resources on relevant policies and regulations in the web3 space to enhance members' understanding of the legal aspects.
Interactive Q&A: Members can ask questions related to web3, and the bot will provide answers or redirect them to relevant resources within the community.
Community Engagement: The bot can facilitate discussions, polls, and announcements to engage members and foster a sense of community within the WhatsApp/discord/telegram group.


By leveraging the  bot as a mentor and guide, communities can empower its members to explore web3 technologies, stay informed about policies, and actively participate in the community's educational initiatives.

idea is to start with discord bot then build whatsapp& telegram bots. Leveraging AI this tool will act as a learning mentor for the community members 

one line problem statement: new comers dont know where to start n they have lots of queries so our bot can help to curate content /curriculum to start with answer queries, then provide individual specific learning and assessing creating profiles of community members (edited)
